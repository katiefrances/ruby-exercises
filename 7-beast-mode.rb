#
# Build a (CLI) shopping cart
#
# User interface is up to you!
# Plan your solution before diving into code.
#
# - User should be able to list products in cart (and see $total)
# - User should be able to add products to cart
# - User should be able to delete products from cart
#
# Beastmode++
# - Store products in a separate hash
# - Have the cart reference the new products hash
# - Give each product a stock_level
# - Update your app to respect the stock levels
# - Implement a gem to use live currency data E.g. $100 ($126USD)
# - Let the user specifc which currency they'd like to use


# We'll get you started
cart = [{ product: 'iPhone', price: 2000, qty: 10 }]
